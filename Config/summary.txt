Hi there! I'm Masood or as I go by on the internet, DJBIRYANI, a freelance 3D generalist and graphic designer looking for work! I've previously worked in marketing for various companies as a graphic designer and have expanded my horizons into 3D work. I've modelled various props, incorporating existing workflows and finding my own along the way. I've got a drive to continue to learn in this space and I'm looking forward to working with you! P.S. I love appreciating art, from video games to music to giant robot anime, ask me about my favorites!
